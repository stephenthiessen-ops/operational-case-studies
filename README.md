# Operational Case Studies

Sanitized transformation case studies demonstrating how structured operating models, automation, and AI-driven intelligence were applied to scale engineering execution.

Each case study includes:

- Problem context
- Intervention strategy
- System design
- Measurable outcomes
- Lessons learned

These examples focus on operational leverage, not task tracking.
