# System Design

Layer 1 — Execution
- Standardized issue types (Sub-task → Story → Epic → Initiative)
- Unified status taxonomy

Layer 2 — Automation
- Parent auto-transition on child completion
- Story point roll-up logic
- Risk flag automation

Layer 3 — Reporting
- Structured exports feeding BI
- Confidence scoring model
- Dependency heatmap

Result: Execution telemetry became machine-readable and trendable.
